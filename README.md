To make use of this project download the StudentAdvising.zip file (which contains a maven project) and import it into your IDE (you may be able to import the zip file directly, or you will need to unzip it first and load it into your editor, depending on which IDE/editor you use).
Also note that if necessary your IDE/editor must have necessary extensions installed for detecting and running maven projects.
